# You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres.
# There is an infinite amount of water supply available.
# You need to determine whether it is possible to
# measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.
#
# Operations allowed:
#
# Fill any of the jugs completely.
# Empty any of the jugs.
# Pour water from one jug into another till
# the other jug is completely full or
# the first jug itself is empty.
# Example 1:
#
# Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 4
# Output: True
# Example 2:
#
# Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
# Output: False
