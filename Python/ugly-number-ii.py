# Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
#
# Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors
# only include 2, 3, 5. For example,
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the
# first 10 ugly numbers.
#
# Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
#
# Hint:
#
# The naive approach is to call isUgly for every number
# until you reach the nth one. Most numbers are not ugly.
# Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.
